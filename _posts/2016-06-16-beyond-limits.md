<p class="lead">Pushing your limits is a great way to improve. Join me on my first Fotomarathon, a 12 hours photography competition.</p>

I participated in the 16th [Fotomarathon in Berlin](https://fotomarathon.de/en/what-is-a-fotomarathon/) after reading about it in [Synke's blog](http://synke-unterwegs.de/fotomarathon-12h-berlin/). The rules are quite interesting: You get 12 hours to take 12 photos, fitting 12 given subjects. Photos must be taken in a specific order, no editing allowed. To make things even harder, the first picture has to include the starting number.

My brother registered as well and his girlfriend joined to keep company with us. As it turned out, she gladly volunteered to be part of some photos which both of us appreciated.

The lens manufacturer Tamron was the main partner of this year's marathon. They brought a selection of lenses which one could use for the day â€“ free of charge. I decided to try the 35mm F/1.8.

At 11am, the overall topic "Beyond limits" and the first four subtopics were announced. The crowd split up, the journey began. We decided to start the competition with a break. I took a few shots with the borrowed Tamron lens while having a coffee. Both were great.
