title: Creating beautiful graphs for teaching git
category: "dev"

Explaining git can be a challenging task. For instance, last week [I wrote about moving commits to another branch]({% post_url 2015-03-28-git-moving-commits-to-another-branch %}).

To do that, I wanted some kind of visualization. While searching a tool for this job, I noticed that most of them are creating the graph out of some *existing git repository*. Not what I wanted.

Then I found [gitgraph.js](http://gitgraphjs.com/). On the first sight, it seemed like a good fit. But damn, why do they **draw the arrow pointing in the wrong direction**? Not helpful if you want to show some concept and your explaining graph shows the opposite.

Finally, I discovered neat looking graphs produced by a tool named [gitDAGs](https://github.com/Jubobs/gitdags/wiki). It is just a package for LaTeX, built on top of TikZ/PGF.

## Installation

Since the official repository doesn't provide installation instructions, I quickly explain how to install gitDAGs on OS X. [Chris Freemans Tutorial](http://chrisfreeman.github.io/gitdags_install.html) for installing it on Ubuntu was pretty helpful for me.

First, if you don't have it yet, install [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/).

Afterwards, this command should tell you the path for custom packages.

{% highlight bash %}
$ kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME
/Users/<username>/Library/texmf
{% endhighlight %}

You need to create the folder structure for LaTeX packages yourself.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ~/Library
$ mkdir -p texmf/tex/latex
$ cd texmf/tex/latex
{% endhighlight %}

To install the needed packages `xcolor-solarized` and `gitdags`, simply clone their repositories into the created latex folder.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://github.com/Jubobs/xcolor-solarized.git
$ git clone https://github.com/Jubobs/gitdags.git
{% endhighlight %}

After cloning these packages, LaTeX should already be able to see them. You can test this by typing

{% highlight bash %}
$ kpsewhich gitdags.sty
/Users/<username>/Library/texmf/tex/latex/gitdags/gitdags.sty
{% endhighlight %}

When some path is shown, you are ready to generate beautiful git graphs.

## Usage

Head over to the [wiki page of gitdags](https://github.com/Jubobs/gitdags/wiki) and copy the example into some file. Then, compile with `pdflatex` and you get the example graph as a pdf file.

For an [insight into my workflow, see the following post]({% post_url 2015-04-12-gitdags-my-workflow %}).

Stay tuned and Happy Easter!
