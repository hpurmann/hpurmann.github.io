My name is Hendrik Purmann, I'm a Berlin-based software engineer, currently working for [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com).

I love creating software which solves real-world problems. The field is always evolving, there is so much to learn.
Being able to work from anywhere in the world is liberating.
