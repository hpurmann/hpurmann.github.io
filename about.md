My name is Hendrik Purmann, I'm a Berlin-based software engineer, currently working for [Actano](https://rplan.com).

I love creating software which solves real-world problems. The field is always evolving, there is so much to learn.
Being able to work from anywhere in the world is liberating.

<!--
I love creating software. When I was 13, I had the urge to create my own website.
Making a living with developing software became my dream at that time.
I enrolled in university to get a computer science degree.
Gaining theoretical background was interesting but my passion has always been creating something.
Therefore I applied for a junior software engineering position.
